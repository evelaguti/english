>## Relevant linguistic elements to write in English

When writing in English there are some relevant aspects we need to take into account. Firstly, we need to identify linguistic elements that will allow us to write in a more polished and clear way. Secondly, there are rules that we should bear in mind for writing sentences, paragraphs and even whole compositions.

What are some basic elements of speech?
The elements of speech are types of words, punctuation marks or use of language that make differences when we use them. We can use these elements of speech as a way of classifying the grammatical functions of certain words, or the purpose of specific punctuation marks.

```Nouns```: Words to designate names, people, animals, things, ideas, etc. They can be singular or plural and they can become possessives.
```
Example: The dog is a great animal and it’s usually consider humans’ best friends.
```

```Pronouns```: Words used to replace specific nouns. We can replace the name Yesica for the pronoun she.
```
Example: John is a great teacher, he always prepares great activities.
```

```Verbs```: These are words that express an action; they are supposed to be conjugated accordingly to the moment in which they occur.
```
Example: I worked really hard over the weekend; I’m exhausted.
```

```Adjectives```: Words that are used to qualify nouns. Generally they are located before the noun and they are never pluralized.
```
Example: There are many interesting courses at Platzi.
```

```Adverbs```: The qualify adjectives and verbs. They provide specific information about degree, frequency, place or manner.
```
Example: The work at the company is fairly good.
```

```Prepositions```: Words that are used to show the relationship between a noun or a pronoun with the other words of the sentence. Sometimes, prepositions work as meaning modifiers.
```
Example: The already on the platform.
```

```Conjunctions```: Words that connect words, sentences or clauses. They are usually classified in “and”, “or” and “but”.
```
Example: The activities that have to be done are: revising, re-writing and publishing.
```
>#### Punctuation

Use ```CAPITALIZATION``` whenever you start a sentence.

<!--breapage-->
Finish every sentence with a punctuation mark like a period, a question mark or a exclamation.
Use semicolons when you want to separate a clause from another or when you want to introduce a counter argument.
Use commas to separate elements, or to introduce an idea after a conjunction.

>## The writing process

```Pre-writing```: research about the topic that you are going to be writing about, you can use brainstorming or mind mapping for this purpose

```Pre-composing```: start using outline in order to organize the idea.

```Writing```: just write the idea that you already have done in the previous steps.

```Revision```: check what are those mistakes that you made in punctuation, , missing some words, repetitive words, etc.

```Re-writing```: polish into a better version.

```Checking```: reread because maybe you can improve the text.

```Publish```: can be in a Social Media, Magazine, Blog, News, etc.

>### Writing a topic sentence
- ```Topic```: The subject that you are talking about.
- ```Controlling Idea```: What is it that you are going to say about that topic.
>### How to create an outline

#### Why an outline?
- It’s always good to define a structure.
- It gives us an overview of the text.
- It helps us to accomplish the objectives.

#### How are we going to create an outline?
- Read extensively about the topic.
- Define what the purpose of the text is.
- Define the sections that you will have.
- Identify the ideas you will develop in each section.
- Close the text.
